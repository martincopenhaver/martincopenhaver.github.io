I am an operations researcher in the Office of Capacity Management at [Johns Hopkins Hospital](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/the-johns-hopkins-hospital) and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. My research and teaching interests lie in the design, implementation, and evaluation of new models for patient flow in hospitals with a particular focus on quality of care and patient outcomes. Methodologically, I develop and use tools from optimization, statistics, and machine learning, and I collaborate with the [Center for Data Science in Emergency Medicine](https://cdem.jh.edu). Prior to being at Hopkins, I was on the Healthcare Systems Engineering team at [Massachusetts General Hospital](http://www.massgeneral.org/) for five years, a member of the faculty at Harvard Medical School, and a senior lecturer in operations research and statistics at the [MIT Sloan School of Management](http://sloan.mit.edu/). I completed my Ph.D. in Operations Research at MIT's [Operations Research Center](http://orc.mit.edu/).
