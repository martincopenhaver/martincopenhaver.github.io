I am a senior clinical data scientist on the Healthcare Systems Engineering team at [Massachusetts General Hospital](http://www.massgeneral.org/) and an Instructor in Anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School. My research and teaching interests lie in the design, implementation, and evaluation of new healthcare delivery systems, especially using tools from optimization and statistics. I have previously held the role of senior lecturer in operations research and statistics at the [MIT Sloan School of Management](http://sloan.mit.edu/). I completed my Ph.D. in Operations Research at MIT's [Operations Research Center](http://orc.mit.edu/).
