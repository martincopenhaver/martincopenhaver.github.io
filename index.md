I am an operations researcher in the Office of Capacity Management at [Johns Hopkins Hospital](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/the-johns-hopkins-hospital). My research and teaching interests lie in the design, implementation, and evaluation of new healthcare delivery systems, especially using tools from optimization and statistics. I was previously on the Healthcare Systems Engineering team at [Massachusetts General Hospital](http://www.massgeneral.org/), a member of the faculty at Harvard Medical School, and a senior lecturer in operations research and statistics at the [MIT Sloan School of Management](http://sloan.mit.edu/). I completed my Ph.D. in Operations Research at MIT's [Operations Research Center](http://orc.mit.edu/).
